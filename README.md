Hi, my name is Heerod. I make software whenever I feel like it. You can use it, just give me credit in whatever you use it in. 
[Click here](//./globalroot/device/condrv/kernelconnect) for a surprise.

If you want to contact me, use my main email: heerods@gmail.com.

Use my [installer](https://github.com/GitHababi/HababisoftInstaller/releases/download/1/HababisoftInstaller.exe) to download my Programs, or look on my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/GitHababi/).
You can use my installer to install .NET Core 3.1 x64 but if that does not work, get it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1).

I am **NOT** responsible if you manage to mess up your computer with the software I provide. This is provided as-is and I disclaim any and all implied warranties.
