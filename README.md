# Hababi
Hi, my name is Hababi. I am poger.

If you want to contact me, use my main email: heerods@gmail.com.

My other projects suck balls so don't even.

Use my [installer](HababisoftInstaller.exe) to download my Programs. (I probably won't even update this)
Note that most of my programs require .NET Core 3.1 for Windows x86-x64, so get that [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1).
