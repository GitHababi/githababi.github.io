Hi, my name is Heerod. I make software whenever I feel like it. You can use it, just give me credit in whatever you use it in.

If you want to contact me, use my main email: heerods@gmail.com.

Look on my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/GitHababi/). To see my publicly posted projects and things.
Some of my programs require you to install .NET Core 3.1 x86-64, get it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1).

I am **NOT** responsible if you manage to mess up your computer with the software I provide. This is provided as-is and I disclaim any and all implied warranties.
